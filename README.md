# zurb-foundation-5-prebuilt
Zurb's Foundation 5 - prebuilt. Get started quickly.  No need for SASS, bower, gulp, etc.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/zurb-foundation-5-prebuilt.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/zurb-foundation-5-prebuilt)

## Notes
The code contained in the package is the same as the official release.  Except:
* jQuery v3+ seems to be causing a JavaScript error, so I packaged up jQuery v2.2.4
